    :target: https://travis-ci.org/johnthagen/python-blueprint

Example Python project that demonstrates how to create a Python project using the latest
Python testing and linting tooling.

Requirements
============

Python 2.7 or 3.4+.

.. note::

    Because `Python 2.7 supports ends January 1, 2020 <https://pythonclock.org/>`_, new projects
    may want to consider supporting Python 3 only, which is simpler than trying to support both.
    Support for Python 2.7 in this example project is provided only for completeness.
